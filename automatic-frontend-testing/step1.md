# Introduction
An important part of the DevOps architecture is the testing of the product. We must ensure to our customer that our product works as intended, before and after we apply our changes.

A website can be made in many ways, but a common strategy is to store the frontend and backend separately. As coderswWe usually test the individual functions in each part separately.

However, a customer does not see the website as code with a frontend and a backend. The customer sees the website as a website. As coders, we must ensure that the customer experience on the website should work without any issues. However, testing a website by hand is cumbersome and it's difficult to try out all combinations of button pressings.

Selenium is a framework for testing websites automatically. In this tutorial, we will introduce Selenium with `python` and use it for testing websites.
